Belly Button Biodiversity
Data from the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset was used to build a dashboard.

This data suggests that microbacteria called OTU were present in greater then 70% of humans. i wonder if the type of belly buttons effect this bacteria and it's growth! maybe an outie really is more hygenic!
